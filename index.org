* FAQ

** What is the procedure to install every component on a new machine?
   
   1) Install the shared utility framework. See [[./projects/tk-utility/user-documentation.html][notes]].
   2) Install the session controller. See [[./projects/tk-session/user-documentation.html][notes]].
   3) If bundles are out of date ([[How do I know if my bundles are up to date?][How do I know if my bundles are up
      to date?]]), download and install current bundle package. See
      [[./projects/bundles/index.html][notes]].

** The session is jumping to a component in the middle of the session instead of starting at the beginning. How do I prevent this?
   
   This is the expected recovery behavior for the session. Most
   likely a registry file still exists in the session's temporary
   directory and it is trying to recover because this is the defined
   recovery condition. If you want to reset, *note that you will lose
   any information from the crashed session*, you will need to find
   and remove:

   : /Applications/TK-Session.app/Contents/_TEMP/regfile.plist

   After this, restarting the program should result in a fresh start.
   
** The program is crashing, but I'm not sure why. Where can I find helpful information?
   
   The session controller logs important information to the
   Console. In the event of a crash, it is the session controller's
   intention to log useful information for further analysis. You can
   access this information by opening Console application found at:

   : /Applications/Utilities/Console.app

** How do I know if my bundles are up to date?
   
   This currently requires many steps . . . I'm debating whether I
   should write a helper function for this. You basically have to
   look into the Contents directory of each bundle and read the
   version number from the plist file.

     place

** Install/Update Component Bundle

*** Option 1 -- Install/Update Entire Bundle Pack
    
    - Download the current bundle pack: [[./releases/bundles/bundle-pack-current.zip][current release]]
    - Move the file (unpacking if needed) to:

** NEXT Create a Session Configuration File

   The session configuration file is the driving force behind the
   session. It should contain all information required to determine
   the structure of a given session.

   You can view documentation in the browser as [[./dox/how-to-create-a-session-config-file.html][HTML]] or download as a
   [[./dox/how-to-create-a-session-config-file.pdf][PDF]].
